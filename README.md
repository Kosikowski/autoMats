```

## Benefits
1. Consistency: Ensure consistent structure, naming conventions, and organization across your test codebase.
2. Readability: Improve readability and understanding of test suites by enforcing clear and descriptive naming conventions.
3. Automation: Automates work normally done during a code review.
4. Quality: Detect potential issues or violations of coding conventions early in the development process, leading to higher code quality and consistency.
